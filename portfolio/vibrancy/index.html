<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Spatial revitalization has been widely regarded as the main goal for urban design. The increasing availability of multi-source data in recent years enables researchers to create better metrics to evaluate vibrancy. Despite the consensus that the count of people flow works as a significant indicator, it is incomplete for loosing information about activities in which people are involved. In order to have a more direct understanding of urban vibrancy, this paper measures the interactions among people, which are some of the liveliest activities to be encourage. To identify where and when interactions happen in urban space through camera data, we construct a framework with 2 steps. Individual-specific routes are firstly tracked, and then each pair of routes is binarily classified in terms of whether the two persons have communications. For the latter task, a customized deep neural network is proposed and trained, achieving a validating accuracy of 85%.  All these techniques are integrated into a GUI, with special designs for human-computer interactions that allow automatically processed outcomes being further corrected manually. Utilizing this methodology, an empirical study is carried out on an internal street of a traditional residential neighborhood in Shanghai, China, where Tongji University introduced a variety of radical living labs into the underutilized store front spaces to vitalize the community. Camera data are collected in a privacy-preserving way by not recording video footage and identity related information. We use the data to measure the impact of urban intervention by observing the change of human interaction density in before and after scenarios. The analysis shows a low occurrence of interactions before urban intervention, indicating poor vibrancy performance. By contrast, interaction density increased during and after urban intervention.</p>
