      <description>Cross-City Transfer Learning for Anti-epidemic Policies and Traffic Flow Prediction   Abstract In recent years, with the maturity of sensing technology and computing environment, various kinds of big data have been quietly born in cities, such as traffic flow, weather data, road networks, points of interest, mobile trajectories and social media. However, the imbalance of urban development level and the heterogeneity of urban data make it extremely challenging to generalize urban computing on a large scale, and most of the existing urban knowledge migration work focuses on one specific task, modeling and optimizing for specific datasets.</description>

      <description>Event Encryption for Neuromorphic Vision Sensors: Framework, Algorithm, and Evaluation     Abstract Nowadays, our lives have benefited from various vision-based applications, such as video surveillance, human identification and aided driving. Unauthorized access to the vision-related data greatly threatens users’ privacy, and many encryption schemes have been proposed to secure images and videos in those conventional scenarios. Neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS) is a brand new kind of bio-inspired sensor that can generate a stream of impulse-like events rather than synchronized image frames, which reduces the sensor’s latency and broadens the applications in surveillance and identification.</description>

      <description>Identifying human interactions in built environment: deep learning analytics on camera data for urban vibrancy evaluation   Abstract Spatial revitalization has been widely regarded as the main goal for urban design. The increasing availability of multi-source data in recent years enables researchers to create better metrics to evaluate vibrancy. Despite the consensus that the count of people flow works as a significant indicator, it is incomplete for loosing information about activities in which people are involved.</description>

      <description>Understanding Detailed Spatial Temporal Activities and Urban Vibrancy via Wi-Fi Big Data: Case of LivingLine Shanghai as an Urban Prototype   Abstract Urban vibrancy is a topic of great concern in the field of urban design and planning. However, the definition and measurement of urban vibrancy have not been consistently and clearly followed. With the development of technologies such as big data and machine learning, urban researchers have been able to adopt some new methods that break the tradition to quantitatively evaluate urban vibrancy.</description>

      <title>Parasite-Host Network for Video Crowd Counting</title>

      <description>Parasite-Host Network for Video Crowd Counting   Demo Video, Github
Abstract Crowd counting plays an increasingly important role in public security. Recently, many crowd counting methods for a single image have been proposed but few studies have focused on using temporal information from image sequences of videos to improve prediction performance. In the existing methods using videos for crowd estimation, temporal features and spatial features are modeled jointly for the prediction, which makes the model less efficient in extracting spatiotemporal features and difficult to improve the performance of predictions.</description>

      <description>Supporting Therapeutic Storytelling and Therapist’s Neutrality in Sandtray Therapy Through a Digital Twin   Abstract Sandtray therapy is a form of expressive therapy. Taking the form of a digital twin system, we present a novel tool to support sandtray therapy, designed to inspire the client’s self-expression and use quantitative data to supervise therapists to become more neutral. As figurines are placed by clients, the screen displays a living virtual world synchronously using computer vision.</description>
