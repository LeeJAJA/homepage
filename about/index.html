<p>My name is Jiajie Li (李嘉杰), and I also go by <strong>Chance</strong>. I am a junior undergrad at School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, where I am fortunate to be jointly advised by <a href="https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/Data/View/3914">Shengjie Zhao</a> and <a href="https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/Data/View/3142">Hongming Zhu</a>. I am also pleased to have worked with <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/ryanz/overview/">Yan Zhang</a> and <a href="http://wangc.net/">Can Wang</a> during my undergraduate years.</p>
<p>I am currently interning at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)</a> as a Research SDE, I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/city-science-network/overview/">City Science Network</a>, and I am part of the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/city-science-lab-shanghai/overview/">City Science Lab@Shanghai</a>.</p>
<p>I have a wide range of interests, I am a <a href="https://ydydj.univsport.com/index.php?m=index&amp;c=look&amp;a=seach_look&amp;number=&amp;user_name=%E6%9D%8E%E5%98%89%E6%9D%B0&amp;dengji=&amp;item=&amp;dict_value=&amp;number2=&amp;number3=&amp;start_time=&amp;end_time=">national track and field athlete</a> and a <a href="https://www.ted.com/profiles/9450811/about">licensed TEDx organizer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h2>
<p>My research path and motivation for learning comes from my strong interest in R&amp;D. My goal as a researcher is to use technology to make a positive impact on society nowadays, and I always try to explore the intersection of different disciplines and enjoy the creative process.</p>
<p>I have been programming since I was 11 years old and have been active in the open source community. Since starting my undergraduate studies, I have continued my computer science research, which has given me a wealth of experience in deep learning, computer vision, and mathematical modeling. But. as I&rsquo;ve gotten deeper into the discipline, I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;m not exactly at the center of the discipline, but rather enjoy exploring the connections between different disciplines, so I&rsquo;ve been collaborating with colleagues from different disciplinary backgrounds.</p>
<p>In the last few years I have been focusing on city science research where I have been using various sensors to perceive the inhabitants and activities in the city, but I gradually realized that I have been invading the lives of others. So currently my research interests are focused on building a privacy-conscious data collection framework using bio-information (e.g. gait) as well as emerging sensors (e.g. event camera).</p>
